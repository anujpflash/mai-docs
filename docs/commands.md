### Removed
Removed Commands are [v2.4.0](https://github.com/maisans-maid/Mai/tree/2.4.0) commands that haven't made its way to the 3.0.0 (latest) update because of some various reasons. They are either WIP (Work-in-Progress) or will be entirely forgotten.

Command | category | Removal Reason | Status |
--------|-------------|----------------|:-:|
`anitop` | anime  | Currently Broken (v3.0.0) | 🛠️
`nsfw` | anime | No reason at all, just felt it doesn't fit with the bot | ☠️
`studio` | anime  | Unused command, API Heavy command (Calls on API multiple times to satisfy command conditions) | ☠️
`backdoor` | owner  | Violates Discord ToS | ☠️
`execute` | owner | Useless Command | ☠️
`automessage` | setup  | Currently Broken (v3.0.0) | 🛠️
`whois` | utility  | Violates Discord ToS. Replaced with [`userinfo`](#utility) command | ☠️


 - All of the music command from the previous version, [2.4.0](https://github.com/maisans-maid/Mai/tree/2.4.0/commands/music), has been removed due to the hosting limitations of the bot. These commands, however, are almost complete (for the latest version) but will never be pushed unless the bot gets a proper hosting service. If you forked the latest (3.0.0) version and want to use the music feature, feel free to open an issue. I will create a branch for it if someone is interested once it is complete.
