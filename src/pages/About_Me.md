My Name is [Mai Sakurajima](https://myanimelist.net/character/118739/Mai_Sakurajima) and i am from the anime [Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/37450/Seishun_Buta_Yarou_wa_Bunny_Girl_Senpai_no_Yume_wo_Minai), known in english as Rascal Does not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai.<br/><br/>
I am a professional model and an actress since I was a kid but unfortunate events pressured me into wishing to disappear on this world. Luckily, as my wish was unfortunately been granted, a prince-charming named [Sakuta Azusagawa](https://myanimelist.net/character/118733/Sakuta_Azusagawa) appeared and saved me from that peril.<br/><br/>
Reasons why you should switch waifus and pick me instead:
<li>I am cute</li>
<li>I can cook</li>
<li>I wear bunny ears</li>
<li>I am a bunny girl</li>
<li>I am Perfect</li><br/>
This is more than enough reason to invite me as a bot too!
